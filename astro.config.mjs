 * A STATIC site: every page is prerendered to plain files in `dist/` (no
 * adapter, no server code). The platform serves them as they are; a root
 * `404.html` answers every miss. The blog is Markdown in `src/content/blog/`,
 * built into pages like everything else.
 *
 * Search and feeds are files too: `/sitemap.xml`, `/robots.txt` and
 * `/rss.xml` are built from `src/pages/*.xml.ts` / `robots.txt.ts`.
 *
 * Navigation is client-side (`<ClientRouter />` in Base.astro) between real
 * prerendered pages (best for search): the next page is fetched ahead by
 * `prefetch` (below) and swapped in without a reload.
