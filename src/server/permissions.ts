 * THE permission catalogue: every codename this site checks, declared ONCE.
 * Adding an entry here is the whole job (docs/agent/roles-and-permissions.md):
 *
 *   - `PERMISSIONS.<KEY>` is its codename, for `requirePermission` / `can`;
 *   - `ability` adds a flag to `/me` `abilities` (and to the `Abilities` type)
 *     for the UI: portal nav items, buttons, `pageContext()` pages;
 *   - the row reaches the `permissions` table (the roles screen) on the next
 *     signed-in request after deploy, and `roles` get it that first time only
 *     (`src/platform/permission-sync.ts`). No migration.
 *
 * Never rename or reuse a shipped codename: roles hold it by name. Browser-safe
 * (no server imports): the portal reads the `Abilities` type from here.
